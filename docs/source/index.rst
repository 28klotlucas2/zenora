Zenora
======

Zenora is a synchronous library for accessing the Discord REST API. 

It allows you to access the API without async/await. And also gives you REST-only API access, not the gateway. 
Pretty useful for making bot web dashboards, or desktop applications, etc. Oauth and other features will be added soon.


This library is currently unfinished but you can help speed up the development by contributing and submitting pull requests to the repository.
It is working in its current state but I'd love to see more functionality added further down the line!

Repository: `View on GitHub <https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora>`_

If you need any help with this library at any point feel free to DM me on Discord (Ahnaf#4346).

If you think you have found a bug or other problem with the library, or you would like to suggest a feature,
you should submit an issue on the GitHub repository `here <https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora/issues>`_.
Before doing so you should make sure you are on the latest version of the library and check to see if an issue
already exists for your bug or feature.
